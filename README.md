EPUB Fixer

Some EPUB's aren't really epubs! They're actually the older format OEBPS, which Google Books does not support. This is a little script to fix them to follow the EPUB standard so they can be loaded into google books.

It seems to be libreoffice that generates these files at least, from some light novel authors, but i'm not certain
